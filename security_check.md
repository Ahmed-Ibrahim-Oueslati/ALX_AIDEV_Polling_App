The Challenge: Security Audit & Remediation
As a developer, writing functional code is only half the battle. Ensuring that the code is secure, robust, and free of vulnerabilities is just as critical. This version of ALX Polly has been intentionally built with several security flaws, providing a real-world scenario for you to practice your security auditing skills.

Your mission is to act as an AI security engineer tasked with auditing this codebase.

Your Objectives:
Identify Vulnerabilities:

Thoroughly review the codebase to find security weaknesses.
Pay close attention to user authentication, data access, and business logic.
Think about how a malicious actor could misuse the applicationâ€™s features.
Understand the Impact:

For each vulnerability you find, determine the potential impact.Query your AI assistant about it. What data could be exposed? What unauthorized actions could be performed?
Propose and Implement Fixes:

Once a vulnerability is identified, ask your AI assistant to fix it.
Write secure, efficient, and clean code to patch the security holes.
Ensure that your fixes do not break existing functionality for legitimate users.
